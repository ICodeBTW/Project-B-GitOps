(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\n                  targeted conformance profile:\n\n                  HTTP Profile\n\n                  1.

TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n                  1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n                     Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n                     \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n                     with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n                  Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\n                  whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\n                  for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n                  When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\n                  Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\n                  Listener to be distinct.\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\n                  accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\n                  Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\n                  This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\n                  Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\n                  least one Listener must be present.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if\n                  Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations that do\n                  not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean\n                        the full Route).

(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\n                  targeted conformance profile:\n\n                  HTTP Profile\n\n                  1.

TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n                  1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n                     Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n                     \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n                     with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n                  Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\n                  whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\n                  for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n                  When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\n                  Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\n                  Listener to be distinct.\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\n                  accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\n                  Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\n                  This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\n                  Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\n                  least one Listener must be present.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if\n                  Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations that do\n                  not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.

Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean\n                        the full Route).

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

On the other\n                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.\n\n                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted\n                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the\n                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,\n                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none\n                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by\n                  the implementation.

ReferenceGrant is\n                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\n                  create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\n                  Route.\n\n                  There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\n                  resources.\n\n                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\n                  Some examples:\n\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n                    same object must also set `sectionName`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n                    object must also set `port`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\n                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\n                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\n                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\n                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\n                  merged.\n\n                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\n                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\n                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered\n                    a parent of this resource (usually a route).

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                        both specified values.\n\n                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\n                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\n                        interpreted.\n\n                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\n                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\n                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\n                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                        Support: Core\n                      maxLength: 253\n                      minLength: 1\n                      pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - name\n                  type: object\n                maxItems: 32\n                type: array\n                x-kubernetes-validations:\n                - message: sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes\n                    2 or more references to the same parent\n                  rule: 'self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind\n                    == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__)\n                    || p1.__namespace__ == '''') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__\n                    == '''')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026\n                    p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?

(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\n                  targeted conformance profile:\n\n                  HTTP Profile\n\n                  1.

TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n                  1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n                     Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n                     \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n                     with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n                  Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\n                  whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\n                  for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n                  When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\n                  Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\n                  Listener to be distinct.\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\n                  accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\n                  Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\n                  This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\n                  Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\n                  least one Listener must be present.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if\n                  Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations that do\n                  not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean\n                        the full Route).

(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their\n                  targeted conformance profile:\n\n                  HTTP Profile\n\n                  1.

TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:\n\n                  1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"\n                     Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or\n                     \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.\n                  3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener\n                     with the same Protocol has the same Port value.\n\n                  Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect\n                  whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant\n                  for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\n                  When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol\n                  Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the\n                  Listener to be distinct.\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may\n                  accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting\n                  Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.\n                  This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting\n                  Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at\n                  least one Listener must be present.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if\n                  Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations that do\n                  not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.

Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean\n                        the full Route).

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

On the other\n                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.\n\n                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted\n                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the\n                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,\n                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none\n                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by\n                  the implementation.

ReferenceGrant is\n                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\n                  create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\n                  Route.\n\n                  There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\n                  resources.\n\n                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\n                  Some examples:\n\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n                    same object must also set `sectionName`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n                    object must also set `port`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\n                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\n                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\n                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\n                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\n                  merged.\n\n                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\n                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\n                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered\n                    a parent of this resource (usually a route).

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                        both specified values.\n\n                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\n                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\n                        interpreted.\n\n                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\n                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\n                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\n                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                        Support: Core\n                      maxLength: 253\n                      minLength: 1\n                      pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - name\n                  type: object\n                maxItems: 32\n                type: array\n                x-kubernetes-validations:\n                - message: sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes\n                    2 or more references to the same parent\n                  rule: 'self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind\n                    == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__)\n                    || p1.__namespace__ == '''') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__\n                    == '''')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026\n                    p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?
